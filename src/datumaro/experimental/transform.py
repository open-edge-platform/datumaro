class Transform:
    """Base class for all dataframe transformations.

    A Transform represents an operation that can be applied to a dataframe,
    potentially modifying its structure and content.

    This class is not meant to be used directly. It is typically used behind the scene
    by the Dataset class.

    Transforms may support lazy evaluation of certain fields. The list of readily
    available fields is available through get_batch_attributes() while the list of lazy
    fields is available through get_lazy_attributes(). From a behavioral perspective,
    there is no difference between the two types of attributes, but it is recommended
    to avoid fetching lazy attributes until needed as they often require expensive
    operations (such as image loading)

    Transforms can be chained through by passing the parent transform to the
    constructor of the child transform. The only transform which no parent is the
    IdentityTransform which acts as the root of the transform pipeline.
